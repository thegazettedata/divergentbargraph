#Divergent bar graph template

This is a divergent bar graph template used by The Gazette and KCRG. It can be used for comparing numbers above and below a midpoint of interest, drawing bars to the left and right of the midpoint (e.g., to illustrate underrepresentation and overrepresentation of data elements compared to the composite data). It uses a fluid layout for responsiveness.
